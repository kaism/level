level programming language
A pseudo-esoteric programming language.

What is a pseudo-esoteric programming language? It's a language with similar looking structure to a traditional programming language. Except key things are changed to make programming extraordinarily frusterating. Such as:

Using operators universally used for one purpose and giving it something else entirely. For example, when used, '++' universally means incrementation. However, in level, it means addition.

Other changes include making 'num' a key word in place of the traditional 'int'.
