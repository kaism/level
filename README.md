level programming language
A pseudo-esoteric programming language.

What is a pseudo-esoteric programming language? It's a language with familiar looking structure to a traditional programming language at first glance. However, key things are changed to make it confusing to read. Such as:

Using operators universally used for one purpose and giving it a different function entirely. For example, when used, '++' has been widely accapted to mean incrementation. In level, it means addition. Or, replacing common names for control flow sturctures, such as replacing 'if' with 'when'.

Other changes include making 'num' a key word in place of the traditional 'int'.

The 'var' folders stand for variation. var1 is the first variation of a cli calculator and so forth.
